#Election 2013 app

This is the code that ran the WCFCourier's election 2013 app. It uses:
- Bootstrap
- Tabletop
- Handelbars
- jQuery

Note: Before and after the eleciton night, we did not use [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop). Instead we exported the data from our Google spreadsheet into JSON. The code for this is in index.html and js/notabletop.js.

The night of the election, we used Tabletop, which allowed us to enter the election results into our Google spreadsheet and update in real-time.
