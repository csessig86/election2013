#Election 2013 app

This is the code that ran the WCFCourier's election 2013 app. It uses:
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/)
- [Reset](https://code.google.com/p/reset5/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [Tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop)
- [Handelbars.js](http://handlebarsjs.com/)
- [Swag](https://github.com/elving/swag)
- [Underscore.js](http://underscorejs.org/)

Note: Before and after the eleciton night, we did not use [Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop). Instead we exported the data from our Google spreadsheet into JSON. The code for this is in index.html and js/notabletop.js.

The night of the election, we used Tabletop, which allowed us to enter the election results into our Google spreadsheet and update in real-time.
